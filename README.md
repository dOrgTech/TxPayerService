# Tx Payer Service

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/dOrgTech/TxPayerService)

Please note that you MUST set up your environment variables in the netlify settings of your application. So you can customize with your own contract address, method, mnemonic and network where you want to run the service. Follow the pattern of the .env-example file in the root of the project. After setting your environments variables - probably you will need to re deploy so the service updates itself.

IMPORTANT: If you are going to use this as serverless functions, you MUST set up the `WALLET_MNEMONIC` environment variable, otherwise the service will auto generate an address :-)

### Installing

`npm install`

### Running locally

`npm run dev`

### Config Environment

`Set your own .env, checkout .env-example for reference :)`

WHITELISTED_METHODS: The ABI(s) of the contract

WHITELISTED_ADDRESSES: The addresses of the contracts you want to interact with

Note: The whitelisted methods has to be separated with spaces (arguments are separated by commas, not with spaces) - Check the env.example to see the right format
